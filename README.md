Haskell Interpreter — Technical Overview

Haskell is a statically typed, purely functional programming language that emphasizes referential transparency, immutability, and lazy evaluation. It is widely used in academia and industry for tasks that demand high correctness, such as compilers, theorem provers, and financial systems. Haskell’s design is grounded in the lambda calculus and type theory, making it a powerful model for exploring programming language semantics.

I built a Haskell interpreter from scratch as a learning project to deepen my understanding of how functional languages are executed and how their core principles translate into a runtime system.

# Key Learning Goals and Technical Focus

# Parsing and AST Construction
Implemented a lexer and parser to convert Haskell-like syntax into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), enabling structural analysis of expressions such as function application, lambda abstraction, and pattern matching.

# Evaluation Strategy
Designed an interpreter using lazy (non-strict) evaluation, closely following Haskell’s semantics. This required implementing thunks (unevaluated expressions) and controlling when expressions are forced.

# Type System Exploration
Experimented with type inference and type checking mechanisms inspired by the Hindley–Milner type system, which underlies Haskell’s strong static typing.

# Functional Core Semantics
Focused on key functional constructs: higher-order functions, closures, and pure function evaluation.

# Execution Model
Explored the relationship between evaluation order, purity, and side effects, improving my understanding of how interpreters handle functional semantics versus imperative execution.

# Outcome

Building the interpreter provided a deep, hands-on understanding of how functional programming languages operate at the semantic level. It strengthened my grasp of compiler design, type theory, and evaluation models, and it gave me the foundation to explore advanced topics like type inference algorithms, monadic IO modeling, and runtime optimization.
